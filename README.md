# React_app

An online application exercise tracker

This app uses a REST API to add and remove user exercises in MongoDB. It is implemented as a SPA within the React.js framework. The homepage shows a table of evercises from the database and the user can click icons to add, delete, and modify the exercises. The only network traffic after startup is from the app contacting the database to edit, add, delete, or retrieve the exercises stored.

After downloading the files, use 'npm start' to start the router and the app using a localhost server. Start the server 'REST_APi' first and then start the app. The app connects to the server by a proxy on port 3000 after getting started on port 8000.
